            Hi there! I'm Yash Sharma, a Graduate student at Texas State University,
            currently pursuing a M.S in Data Analytics and Information Systems. Based in Austin, Texas,
            I specialize in data analysis, algorithm design, and web development, with hands-on experience in Python,
            SQL, artificial intelligence, and full-stack development. I’ve completed an internship at Onsemi,
            worked on real-world semiconductor datasets, and competed in high-performance computing challenges with NASA,
            AWS, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, competing with student teams from schools across the nation.
            Alongside my technical work, I am a self-taught artist, exploring multiple mediums to blend creativity with technology.

                On April 25, 2025, I gave a lecture called <em>Patterns in Pixels: What Data Reveals About AI-Generated Art</em>,
                where I analyzed over 5,000 digital artworks across platforms like DeviantArt, Instagram, and Opensea. Using Python and Pandas, I explored engagement,
                pricing, and creator activity, showing that AI and hybrid art are holding their own alongside human-created work. The talk highlighted trends in visibility, revenue,
                and audience interaction, giving a clear picture of how AI is shaping the digital art world. It was a great opportunity to combine my programming skills with my interest
                in art and data, sharing insights with a wider audience.

                This summer 2025, I’ll be interning at Onsemi as a Data Analytics and Business Systems Intern.
                I’ll be working with general semiconductor processes, including production workflows, inventory management, and manufacturing optimization,
                using data-driven insights to help improve efficiency and operational performance. It’s an exciting opportunity to see how complex semiconductor systems operate at scale,
                while contributing to Onsemi’s innovative solutions in the industry.
