                My name is Yash Sharma. I’m an Austin-based Analyst, Programmer, and Artist with over five years of experience in data analysis, algorithm design, database and software development. I earned my Bachelor’s in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from <strong>Texas Tech University</strong> and am currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Analytics and Information Systems at <strong>Texas State University</strong>. My background blends technical work with a lifelong passion for creating art, giving me a creative and precise approach to problem-solving.

            <p class="about-text">
                I’ve worked on projects that combine modern technology and collaboration, like my Senior Capstone Project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hysxApy8z10" target="_blank"><strong>CollaBand</strong></a>, a real-time music platform for creating and sharing projects. I also competed in the 2023 Winter Classic Invitational Student Cluster Competition with <strong>NASA</strong>, <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>, and <strong>Oak Ridge National Laboratory</strong>. Our team, Team Matador, optimized a small HPC cluster under strict constraints, benchmarked with LINPACK and HPCG, and fine-tuned simulations with WRF, ultimately <strong><a href="https://www.winterclassicinvitational.com/2023-winter-classic-the-finale/" target="_blank">earning 3rd nationwide</a></strong>. I delivered a lecture at Texas State University on AI-generated art, analyzing trends in visibility and value using Python and data visualization. During my summer internship at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333329763865899009/" target="_blank"><strong>Onsemi</strong></a>, I gained hands-on experience in semiconductor processes, inventory management, and operational analytics, building dashboards, tracking production metrics, and analyzing data to generate actionable insights that improved efficiency and reduced bottlenecks in a high-tech manufacturing environment.

            <p class="about-text">
                I’ve been making art for as long as I can remember, and I often measure my life by how my art has grown. Each period, each memory, is tied to what I was making at the time, which makes every piece one of a kind. I started with simple sketches and experimenting with whatever materials I could find, then moved into painting and eventually digital work. Now I mix mediums however it feels right, letting the project guide me. I like challenges that push me into new styles or techniques because figuring them out is part of the process. I spend a lot of time studying other art and media, breaking it down to understand it, and then recreating it with pens, markers, or whatever I have around. Making art is just part of how I live and think, shaping how I approach projects, problem-solving, and creativity in everything I do.
